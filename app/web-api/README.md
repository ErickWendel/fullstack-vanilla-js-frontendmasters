# Building a complete Node.js WebApi + testing with no frameworks

Welcome, this repo is part of my youtube video about Creating and testing a complete Node.js Rest API (With no frameworks). 

First of all, leave your star ðŸŒŸ on this repo.

Access our [**exclusive telegram channel**](https://bit.ly/ErickWendelContentHub) so I'll let you know about all the content I've been producing 

## Features Checklist + Challenges

- Web API

        - [ ] it should test all files on the factories layer
        - Plus
          - [ ] it should reach 100% code coverage (it's currently not possible to get code coverage metrics using only the native Node.js, see [c8](https://www.npmjs.com/package/c8) for this task)

    - Integration / E2E
        - [x] it should test the endpoint for storing heroes' data
